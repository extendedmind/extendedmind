Troika Game (www.troikagame.org)
********************************

Troika (www.troikagame.org) is a method and a game for learning new 
things. A troika is formed when you have a clique of three people and 
a topic.


A troika is formed when you have a clique of three people, from which 
two wish to learn and one wishes to teach. Anybody can thus form a 
Troika and then invite others along.

Premises of Troika:
1. You will fill a gap between people who know something and people 
   who want to learn something.
2. You will engage a minimum of two (2) people.
3. You will talk about Troika. (i.e. Advertise the troika event and 
   share the spirit!)
