                <h3>What is the Extended Mind?</h3>
              </div>
              <p>The Extended Mind is a platform for creating open knowledge. The vision of the Extended Mind 
              is to become the home for high quality open, signed and peer reviewed knowledge.</p>
              <p>Today Wikipedia is the obvious place where open knowledge creation happens, but Wikipedia
              allowes only anonymous encyclopedic knowledge. If a given piece of knowledge does not
              fit the format provided by Wikipedia &ndash; the knowledge is for example valued, personal or
              does not fit under one encyclopedic heading &ndash; there are currently two valid alternatives: 
              a scientific journal or a blog. However where scientific peer review can often takes months of
              work, which greatly limits the number of articles, you can set blog in a matter of minutes,
              but there is no quality assurance for the content you create.
              </p>
              <p>
              The Extended Mind provides an alternative for blogs, scientific journals and Wikipedia: a user can store 
              and share her notes under dynamic and supervised keywords as easily as possible using any of her devices.
              </p> 
            </section>
            <section id="how" class="em-anchor">
              <div class="page-header">
                <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
              </div>
              <p>The author can decide if the note she wants to store is:
              <ol>
                <li>private,</li>
                <li>shared to a group,</li>
                <li>public or</li>
                <li>peer reviewed.</li>
              </ol></p>
              <p>
              A private note is part of the user's personal notebook. A note shared to a group provides means for
              easy and fast co-writing. A public text resembles a blog post, and a peer reviewed note is
              a part of the shared extended mind.</p>
              <p>If the user wants to submit her work as a part of the shared extended mind, she can simply click
              on the keywords under which she wants her note to be peer reviewed. The people who supervise the given
              keywords get a notification of a new submitted note to their verification queue, and can then either accept 
              or reject the note. Extended mind users can also recommend any public note they read to other users, 
              which ensures that the peer review process can never stop quality content from spreading.
